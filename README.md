DES 228 FINAL - STOP THE MYTH

# project overview
Stop the Myth is a conceptual festival dedicated to dismantling the model minority myth. The “model minority” refers to a minority group that is perceived to be more successful than the overall population. In the United States, this myth mostly applies to Asian-Americans. Although it is true that many Asian-Americans have attained high achievements, not many people know the cultural context behind it. 

Furthermore, the model minority myth is dangerous because it puts Asian-Americans into a monolith. It doesn’t recognize that there are differences between the different Asian ethnicities and how it impacts our experiences living in America. The model minority myth also fuels anti-Asian racism, which often gets downplayed or dismissed due to their perceived privilege.

One way this festival is dismantling the model memory myth is to uplift Asian-Americans that don’t fit the stereotype. This festival showcases Asian-American artists, performers, and business-owners, who are often underrepresented in both the media and the real world.
